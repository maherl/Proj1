This project is an attempt to practice newly learnt principles of reproducibility. 
In particular, I will practice these principles in bash, markdown, Make, pandoc, git, github and Notepad.
It will involve discussion of these tools in this process and/or the general workflow.
All will be saved in a Github repository.

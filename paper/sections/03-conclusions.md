Makefile is a useful tool for automating the production of papers or larger projects.
Especially when the individual sections are likely to involve many changes.
It has a fairly steep learning curve;
Once you understand that everything revolves around targets and dependencies, it becomes fairly simple.
I would definitely use Makefile in future for large, data-orientated projects.

I am also glad that I can now comfortably interact with Github and the terminal.
I would say I now have a strong grasp of basic directory commands, branching etc.

I'm sure Makefile has far more capabilities of which I am yet unaware though.
I would be interested in learning more about this tool in future.

Git is a version control system that allows a user to remotely manage code.
In this project, it was used to create the file structure and initiate Notepad.
It also allowed files to be 'pushed' to Github.

Github is a hosting portal where people can upload code from their local systems.
This code can then be shared with others for collaboration purposes.
In this project, it was used to house all the images and text files.

Pandoc is a way of converting a variety of markup formats into others.
This includes HTML, LaTeX, Microsoft Word docs etc.
Pandoc is useful because it understands metadata, footnotes, superscript etc.
This means that it allows for complex documents to be converted.
It is also very useful for typing math.

Markdown is a markup language which is easy to read and write.
It is useful because it is a plain text format but is easy to convert to HTML.
It has a far less extensive syntax than many other languages though.

Probably the "easiest" part was launching Notepad from the terminal.
Really anything involving basic text editing was pretty simple.
The more difficult parts involved file organization from the terminal.
Also, because I am unfamiliar with Github, I struggled a bit with syncing my local files with the repository.

Makefile is a way of automating the process of compiling source files.
Instead of having to re-concatenate files every time you update them, with makefile, you simply run the command 'make' and it is all automatically done for you.
It is important to remmeber to only run 'make' when your working directory is the directory where your 'makefile' is saved.
Also, your 'makefile' should not have any extensions (eg '.txt') it should simply be named 'Makefile'.
Syntactically, with Makefile, you input 'targets' (the 'output' of the makefile) and 'dependants' (the files that are used to make them).

Git is a version control system that allows a user to remotely manage code.
In this project, it was used to create the file structure and initiate Notepad.
When you are done working on a specific portion of a project, it further allows you to 'push' an updated version to github.
With git, you can also track changes between current versions of a file and past versions.

Github is a hosting portal where people can upload code from their local systems.
This code can then be shared with others for collaboration purposes.
In this project, it was used to house all the images and text files.

Pandoc is a way of converting a variety of markup formats into others.
This includes HTML, LaTeX, Microsoft Word docs etc.
Pandoc is useful because it understands metadata, footnotes, superscript etc.
This means that it allows for complex documents to be converted.
It is also very useful for typing math.
In this project, it was the tool which make used to change my 'paper.md' file into a 'paper.html' file.

Markdown is a markup language which is easy to read and write.
It is useful because it is a plain text format but is easy to convert to HTML.
It has a far less extensive syntax than many other languages though.
In this project, it was used as a text editor for all the segments composing the 'paper'.

Probably the "easiest" part was launching Notepad from the terminal.
Really anything involving basic text editing was pretty simple.
The more difficult parts involved file organization from the terminal.
Also, because I am unfamiliar with Github, I struggled a bit with syncing my local files with the repository.

I also found the syntax of Markdown to be kind of challenging.
The whole "target dependency" thing was different to any coding language I'd encountered before.

I didn't get help from anyone else, apart from the GSI of this course, Sindhuja Jeyabel.
My main resource was probably stackoverflow and other such q&a sites.
Overall, I probably spent 10-15 hours on this project.

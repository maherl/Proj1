This project is an attempt to practice newly learnt principles of reproducibility. 
In particular, I will practice these principles in bash, markdown, Make, pandoc, git, github and Notepad.
It will involve discussion of these tools in this process and/or the general workflow.
All will be saved in a Github repository.

The main motivation behind this project is learning how to effectively use the tools mentioned in the Abstract.
I will explain in simple terms what all these programs are and how I used them to complete this project.
Although this project is undertaken at a very individual level, it will be written so as to allow for wider usage.
I hope that it will serve as a useful tutorial to those, like me, with little to no experience with these tools.
Many resources were used to get the job done.
These include:![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat159/stat159-fall-2016/master/projects/proj01/images/git-logo.png)
Git is a version control system that allows a user to remotely manage code.
In this project, it was used to create the file structure and initiate Notepad.
It also allowed files to be 'pushed' to Github.

Github is a hosting portal where people can upload code from their local systems.
This code can then be shared with others for collaboration purposes.
In this project, it was used to house all the images and text files.

Pandoc is a way of converting a variety of markup formats into others.
This includes HTML, LaTeX, Microsoft Word docs etc.
Pandoc is useful because it understands metadata, footnotes, superscript etc.
This means that it allows for complex documents to be converted.
It is also very useful for typing math.

Markdown is a markup language which is easy to read and write.
It is useful because it is a plain text format but is easy to convert to HTML.
It has a far less extensive syntax than many other languages though.

Probably the "easiest" part was launching Notepad from the terminal.
Really anything involving basic text editing was pretty simple.
The more difficult parts involved file organization from the terminal.
Also, because I am unfamiliar with Github, I struggled a bit with syncing my local files with the repository.

I also found the syntax of Markdown to be kind of challenging.
The whole "target dependency" thing was different to any coding language I'd encountered before.

I didn't get help from anyone else, apart from the GSI of this course, Sindhuja Jeyabel.
My main resource was probably stackoverflow and other such q&a sites.
Overall, I probably spent 10-15 hours on this project. Makefile is a useful tool for automating the production of papers or larger projects.
Especially when the individual sections are likely to involve many changes.
It has a fairly steep learning curve;
Once you understand that everything revolves around targets and dependencies, it becomes fairly simple.
I would definitely use Makefile in future for large, data-orientated projects.

I am also glad that I can now comfortably interact with Github and the terminal.
I would say I now have a strong grasp of basic directory commands, branching etc.

I'm sure Makefile has far more capabilities of which I am yet unaware though.
I would be interested in learning more about this tool in future.
In particular, I would like to learn how to better manipulate the files for the HTML output.
At the moment, the images in my HTML document are far too big and it is difficult to read.
